                    <h2>Apply in minutes</h2>
                    <p>It’s free, fast, and won’t impact your credit score. Once you qualify, receive a home budget and start shopping.</p>

                <h2>Build your savings</h2>
                <p>Saving up can be tough. That’s why we built automatic savings into the program–so you can build up your down payment little by little while you rent the home. Buy the home from us whenever you’re ready, or walk away and cash out your savings.</p>

                <h2>Keep your flexibility</h2>
                <p>We get that life happens. Divvy gives you the benefits of homeownership without a 30-year commitment. We keep things flexible for your changing life.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Come as you are</h2>
                <p>Your finances are unique. That can make mortgage approval tricky. Not to worry. We fight for everyone to get a shot at homeownership. No judgment, just solutions.</p>
