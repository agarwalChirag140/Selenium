                <h2>Build your savings</h2>
                <p>Saving up can be tough. That’s why we built automatic savings into the program–so you can build up your down payment little by little while you rent the home. Buy the home from us whenever you’re ready, or walk away and cash out your savings.</p>

                <h2>Keep your flexibility</h2>
                <p>We get that life happens. Divvy gives you the benefits of homeownership without a 30-year commitment. We keep things flexible for your changing life.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Come as you are</h2>
                <p>Your finances are unique. That can make mortgage approval tricky. Not to worry. We fight for everyone to get a shot at homeownership. No judgment, just solutions.</p>

            <p>When our business struggled, we fell on hard times. But we bounced back and we wanted to buy a home again. Divvy gave us the opportunity to do that and we’re so grateful.</p>

            <p>We moved to a new city and found a wonderful neighborhood. But the mortgage was a problem. Divvy was willing to work with us so we could still get the home we wanted.</p>
